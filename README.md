MY PORTFOLIO

In this project we created our portfolio including info about me and my former experience, my skills within frontend development, my projects I have done, and my thoughts about coding.

The website is build with HTML and CSS flexbox and was created out from a template that the website should look like. 

The requirements for this project was the following: 
   - The page should be built with HTML and CSS 
   - You should use flexbox for layout
   - The page should be fully responsive. (mobile, tablet and desktop) 
   – The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. 
   – The page should work well for people that uses screen readers and keyboard navigation. 
   – The HTML code should validate in an validation tool.

This will be a never ending projects which I will constantly add on with my coming skills, projects and thoughts.
